	 * <p> Unordered maps are associative containers that store elements formed by the combination of a key 
	 * value and a mapped value, and which allows for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their 
	 * keys. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> In an unordered_map, the key value is generally used to uniquely identify the element, while the 
	 * mapped value is an object with the content associated to this key. Types of key and mapped value may 
	 * differ. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Internally, the elements in the unordered_map are not sorted in any particular order with respect 
	 * to either their key or mapped values, but organized into buckets depending on their hash values to 
	 * allow for fast access to individual elements directly by their key values (with a constant average 
	 * time complexity on average). </p>
	 *
	 * <p> unordered_map containers are faster than map containers to access individual elements by their 
	 * key, although they are generally less efficient for range iteration through a subset of their 
	 * elements. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Unordered maps implement the direct access operator (operator[]) which allows for direct access of 
	 * the mapped value using its key value as argument. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> In the reference for the unordered_map member functions, these same names (Key, T, Hash, Pred and 
	 * Alloc) are assumed for the template parameters. </p>
	 *
	 * <p> Iterators to elements of unordered_map containers access to both the key and the mapped value. 
	 * For this, the class defines what is called its value_type, which is a pair class with its first value 
	 * corresponding to the const version of the key type (template parameter Key) and its second value 
	 * corresponding to the mapped value (template parameter T): </p>
	 *
	 * @code{.cpp}
	 * typedef pair<const Key, T> value_type;
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * <p> Iterators of a unordered_map container point to elements of this value_type. Thus, for an iterator 
	 * called it that points to an element of a map, its key and mapped value can be accessed respectively 
	 * with: </p>
	 *
	 * @code{.cpp}
	 * unordered_map<Key,T>::iterator it;
	 * (*it).first;             // the key value (of type Key)
	 * (*it).second;            // the mapped value (of type T)
	 * (*it);                   // the "element value" (of type pair<const Key,T>)
	 * @endcode
	 *
	 * <p> Naturally, any other direct access operator, such as -> or [] can be used, for example: </p>
	 *
	 * @code{.cpp}
	 * it->first;               // same as (*it).first   (the key value)
	 * it->second;              // same as (*it).second  (the mapped value) 
	 * @endcode

	 * @tparam Key Type of the key values. Each element in an unordered_map is uniquely identified by its key 
	 *			   value. Aliased as member type unordered_map::key_type.
	 *
	 * @tparam T Type of the mapped value. Each element in an unordered_map is used to store some data as its 
	 *			 mapped value. Aliased as member type unordered_map::mapped_type. Note that this is not the 
	 *			 same as unordered_map::value_type.
	 *
	 * @tparam Hash A unary function object type that takes an object of type key type as argument and 
	 *				returns a unique value of type size_t based on it. This can either be a class implementing 
	 *				a function call operator or a pointer to a function (see constructor for an example). 
	 *				This defaults to hash<Key>, which returns a hash value with a probability of collision 
	 *				approaching 1.0/std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max(). The unordered_map object uses the 
	 *				hash values returned by this function to organize its elements internally, speeding up 
	 *				the process of locating individual elements. Aliased as member type unordered_map::hasher.
	 *
	 * @tparam Alloc Type of the allocator object used to define the storage allocation model. By default, 
	 *				 the allocator class template is used, which defines the simplest memory allocation model 
	 *				 and is value-independent. Aliased as member type unordered_map::allocator_type.
